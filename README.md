# cab_fare_prediction_model

## Under this project 

- I have a developed a model to predict the amount of fare that will be charged on the basis of the pickup and drop-off point of the ride. 
- I have made use of missing value analysis to deal with all the missing data present in the dataset. 
- I have also successfully dealt with outliers of this dataset. 
- I have made use of data visualisaiton methods to underdstand the data correctly first. 
- I have used multi linear regression and random forests techniques to make my prediction model and later I have used RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) to evaluate and compare the accuracy of both the models. 
- I have used the above models to predict data in a test dataset. This project was done in R language.
